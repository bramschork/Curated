# Curated

### About the Project
Hi - I'm Bram. I constantly come across cool websites and products I wish I could share. My bookmarks bar is an overflowing mess of hundreds of different catgeories of products, each offering a cool solution to a specific niche. That's why I created Curated, a simple list to track all those cool services.

Have a suggestion for the list? Please fill out the [suggestion form here.](https://form.jotform.com/250145728035049) If you want to chat, my email is [bram@bramschork.com](mailto:bram@bramschork.com).
